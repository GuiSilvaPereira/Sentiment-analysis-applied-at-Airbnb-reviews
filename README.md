# Sentiment analysis applied at Airbnb reviews

This project was developed during the course Data Mining II from Data Analytics' Master at University of Porto, we applied NLP techniques using Python and Jupyter notebooks in order to extract valuables insights from exploring unstructured text data of Airbnb's accommodation reviews.

**Introduction**

Natural language processing (NLP) is a theory-motivated range of computational techniques for the automatic analysis and representation of human language.” Cambria (2014).
In other words, NLP is a way that machines and computers under-stand our language. In this context, the project will explore a case study about Text Mining which nowadays is a very powerful technique to evaluate large collections of documents and discover new infor-mation and answer questions. Considering the amount of information present on the World Wide Web. However, the most of this text data is produced for human consumption, leading to unstructured data which requires pre-processing techniques to make the data understandable to the machines.
In the scope of this project, sentiment analysis was done, which it is the process used to determine the emotional tone for of a piece of text. This analysis It is an important tool for businesses in order to understand customer feedback, social media sentiment, and brand reputation due to their sentiment analysis has several diverse applications in the real world.
Intended to make this the sentiment analysis, we used the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for that. It consists of a package from Python which provides a wide range of libraries for text analysis, furthermore, it is widely used, well-documented and has a large community of users and contributors. NLTK includes pre-trained models for sentiment analysis, which was used to classify the sentiment of Airbnb reviews (a piece of text) as positive, negative, or neutral.
The data used was collected from insideairbnb.com which is a project that provides data about Airbnb services along the world. Within the data available on the site, we chose to analyze the data concerning the guest reviews and the data about the accommodation’s characteristics.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate with real data the challenges of transforming a business problem into a data problem, through a huge quantity of data available from guest reviews for Airbnb accommodations at the Boston City between 2015 and 2023.
Leading to how text mining and sentiment analysis can be used to extract insights from a large volume of unstructured data, and how it can help businesses make data-driven decisions that improve customer satisfaction.

**Background and problem description**

The tourism industry has always been heavily connected to customer satisfaction. With the rise of online platforms such as Airbnb, the volume of guest reviews has increased exponentially. Considering that manually analyzing this vast amount of data can be time-consuming and error prone, there is a growing need for automated tools and techniques that allow the extraction of valuable insights from this data.
Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing customer feedback and sentiment in the tourism industry, using NLP and machine learning techniques, sentiment analysis can automatically classify guest reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, and extract valuable insights into customer satisfaction and preferences. We will then use the insights gained from the sentiment analysis to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities, which can be valuable for improving customer satisfaction.
